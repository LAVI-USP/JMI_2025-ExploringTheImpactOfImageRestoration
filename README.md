# Exploring the impact of image restoration in simulating higher dose mammography: effects on the detectability of microcalcifications across different sizes using model observer analysis

It contains the codes for the paper "Exploring the impact of image restoration in simulating higher dose mammography: effects on the detectability of microcalcifications across different sizes using model observer analysis", submitted to the Journal of Medical Imaging (JMI). 
We used The Laboratory for Individualized Breast Radiodensity Assessment ([LIBRA](https://www.med.upenn.edu/sbia/libra.html)), a software package developed by the University of Pennsylvania. 
We also used the Block-matching and 3D filtering ([BM3D](https://webpages.tuni.fi/foi/GCF-BM3D/)) algorithm, a software package developed by the Tampere University of Technology, Department of Signal Processing. The Model Observer used in this work is available in this [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/DIDSR/VICTRE_MO)

## Abstract:
**Purpose**: Breast cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths among women, and digital mammography plays a key role in screening and early detection. The radiation dose on mammographic exams directly influences image quality and radiologists’ performance. We evaluate the impact of an image restoration pipeline—designed to simulate higher dose acquisitions—on the detectability of microcalcifications of various sizes in mammograms acquired at different radiation doses.
